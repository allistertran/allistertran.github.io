				<p>Our lives are so busy that sometimes if not all the time we forget to complete important tasks such as drinking enough water, using sun protection, checking the weather changes in the day etc. There is so much more to keep up with in life in this day in age so making a one stop destination for all the information you need is a great solution. This app hopes to remedy the time we waste jumping from different apps and websites to obtain the information you need, and to also help you function more efficiently in your life, so you have more time for the bigger things in life.

		<h3>USER CASE</h3>	
		<p>This example is in the context of a user during a busy work day. The season is summer, where the humidity is at 100%. This definitely affects a person’s hydration. With Prompte, the user will be alerted at certain intervals to remind them to drink water. </p>

<ul class="grid">
			<li>
                <img src="img/user_case_1.png">
				<p>The user is at work. Extremely busy and unable to keep track of his water intake. They use Prompte to keep track of their water intake and also to receive water reminders on their phone that pop-up every two hours. 
</p>
			</li>
			<li>
                <img src="img/user_case_2.png">
				<p>The user receives a notification to remind them to drink more water. The user can either [ if the user is using an iPhone ] to force touch on the widget to add their water intake or tap on the widget/notification which will redirect them to app page.
